Hi there, 

Thanks for getting to my personal website. Here you will be able to find some information about myself. 

You can have a look at an always updated version of my **[CV](cv/)**, a selected list of **[publications](publications/)** and **[talks](talks/)** I've done over time. Finally, in the **[blog](year-archive/)** section you can access my most recent posts. 

To get in sync with me, you can add me to your **[RSS](feed.xml)** reader, so, you can always stay current. 

If you want to get in touch with me, **[email me](mailto:j@0x30.io)**, **[tweet me](https://twitter.com/ea1het)** or **[skype me](skype:ea1het?call)** (prefereably in that order). I'm a really busy dude; I always touch base back, but, expect some delays. 

On the other hand, if get to my website...

   ... while searching for my ham radio callsign (**[EA1HET](hamradio/)**), you can get more details about ham radio sutff in the **[ham radio section](hamradio/)** of this website.

   ... while looking for information about **The Things Network** initiative in Principado de Asturias (SPAIN), then, you can better visit the **[project's website](http://astuias-iot.github.io)**. 

Much appreciated for your visit _**:)**_
