Hi there, 

Thanks for getting to my personal website. Here you will be able to find some information about myself. You can have a look at an always updated version of my **[CV](cv/)**, a list of **[publications](publications/)** and **[talks](talks/)** I've done over time. Finally, in the **[blog](year-archive/)** section you can access my most recent post. If you want to get sync with me you can add me your **[RSS](feed.xml)** reader, so, you can always stay current.
