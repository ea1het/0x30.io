Hi there, 

Thanks for getting to my personal website. Here you will be able to find some useful information about myself. 

From the menu, you can have access to:

- An always updated version of my **[CV](cv/)**. Even you can download it on PDF format.
- A selected list of **[publications](publications/)** and **[talks](talks/)** I've done over time. 
- A **[blog](year-archive/)** section, where you can access my most recent posts about the things most motivate me, surprise me or deserve attention somethow. 

To get in sync with me, you can either:

- Add me to your **[RSS](feed.xml)** reader, so, you can always stay current. 
- If you prefer a more direct contact, then probably an **[email](mailto:j@0x30.io)**, **[tweet](https://twitter.com/ea1het)** or **[skype call](skype:ea1het?call)** would be better. I'm a really busy dude, but, I always touch base back, so, expect some delays. 

If get to my website:

   - While searching for my ham radio callsign (**[EA1HET](hamradio/)**), you can get more details about ham radio sutff in the **[ham radio section](hamradio/)** of this website.

   - While looking for information about **The Things Network** initiative in Principado de Asturias (SPAIN), then, you can better visit the **[project's website](http://asturias-iot.github.io)**. 

Much appreciated for your visit _**:)**_

Jonathan
